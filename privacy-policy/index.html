                <p>
                    Welcome to Noads's Privacy Policy. This policy describes how
                    we collect, use, and protect your personal information.

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    Noads does not collect any user information. We are
                    committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that no
                    personal data is gathered, stored, or processed by our
                    application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our ad-blocking functionality operates entirely within your
                    browser and does not require or access any personal
                    information to function effectively.

                <p>
                    As Noads does not collect any personal information, we do
                    not use, store, or process any user data. Our service
                    functions without the need for any personal information.

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Since we do not collect or store any personal information,
                    there is no user data at risk. Our application operates
                    locally within your browser, ensuring your privacy and
                    security.

                <p>
                    As we do not collect any personal information, there is no
                    user data for you to access, correct, or delete. Your
                    privacy is inherently protected by our no-data-collection
                    policy.
